# 🛠️ USERS MANAGEMENT APP 🛠️
## 👋 Introduction 👋
Welcome to the project introduction with a short description of its functionality.

Users management application is created for users who want to create their accounts.
Here, users can create their accounts easily using our controller.
At the same time, users can update info about them in their accounts, remove them, or even get all users by range of birthdate.
That's wonderful, isn't it 🤔?
Below, I wrote a short description for each endpoint ⬇

## 🚀 Functionality 🚀
1 **User Controller**:
    - POST: /api/users/register - Register a user
    - PUT: /api/users/{id} - Update wholly a user
    - PATCH: /api/users/{id} - Update partially a user
    - DELETE: /api/users/{id} - Delete a user
    - GET: /api/users/dateRange - Get users by birth date range

## 🎮 How can requests be sent to the endpoints by Postman? 🎮
By the way, you also can try to send requests to the endpoints by using Postman.
I created public collection of endpoints, you can open that by clicking [here](https://www.postman.com/lunar-module-cosmologist-43034160/workspace/my-projects/collection/31108999-19aa8c82-164d-48c3-ac50-daf03c0f0e95?action=share&creator=31108999).
Here are all examples of requests, which can be sent by users. Moreover, you can send requests from swagger by clicking [here](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui.html).

## ⌛ History of creating the project ⌛
History of creating the project was incredible. I will remember that for a long time. I made this project with smile on my face.
I'm ecstatic that I've done it.
Overall, I believe this project meets all functionality requirements and serves as an excellent solution for users to manage their accounts.

## 🤌 Possible improvements 🤌
Overall, I believe this project encompasses all the necessary functionality for interacting with clients.
However, I believe switching here authentication and a lot of features as login and so on could enhance his project way better.
Also, as an option, here can be used outer APIs.
So, it's all what I see here, and conceivably, I'll implement that in my leisure time.

## 🙈 Thank you 🙈
Thank you for reading the presentation, good luck! 💫
